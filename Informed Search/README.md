# Informed Search
## This project undertakes a decision making problem of a 8-puzzle game. Search algorithm will best next move from a given state in the game. 

## Challenge:
Use A* Search Algorithm for solving the 8-puzzle problem, assuming the goal of the 8-puzzle agent is to find the solution in

a.) as few steps as possible Please discuss the heuristics to use.

b.) use search container as priority queue.

c.) use the cost from initial to the current node and the heuristics to identify which node to expand next.

d.) implement the heuristics
