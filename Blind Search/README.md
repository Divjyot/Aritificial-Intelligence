# Blind Search
## This project undertakes a decision making problem of a 8-puzzle game. Search algorithm will best next move from a given state in the game. 

## Challenge:
Implementation of the Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem. 

Tested implementation of BFS and DFS with the following initial and goal states: 
From 1348627_5 to 1238_4765 
From 281_43765 to 1238_4765
From 281463_75 to 1238_4765The  symbol  “_”  represents  empty  slot,  while  the  string  of  numbers  representthe sequence of numeric labels on the tiles of the 8-puzzle from left to right, top to bottom.In each test for each algorithm, output is :

a.) The sequence of actions to move from the initial to the goal state.

b.) The number of steps to solve the problem.

c.) Explanation of the relation between the time and the number of steps that each algorithm takes to solve the problem.
